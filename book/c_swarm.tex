\section{Overview}
This chapter describes Swarm Algorithms.


\subsection{Swarm Intelligence}
Swarm intelligence is the study of computational systems inspired by the collective intelligence that emerges through the cooperation of large numbers of homogeneous agents in the environment. Examples include schools of fish, flocks of birds, and colonies of ants. Such intelligence is decentralized, self-organizing and distributed through out an environment. In nature such systems are commonly used to solve problems such as effective foraging for food, prey evading, or colony re-location. The information is typically stored throughout the participating homogeneous agents, or is stored or communicated in the environment itself such as through the use of pheromones in ants, dancing in bees, and proximity in fish and birds.

The paradigm consists of two dominant sub-fields (1) \emph{Ant Colony Optimization} that investigates probabilistic algorithms inspired by the stigmergy and foraging behavior of ants, and (2) \emph{Particle Swarm Optimization} that investigates probabilistic algorithms inspired by the flocking, schooling and herding. Like evolutionary computation, swarm intelligences are considered adaptive strategies and are typically applied to search and optimization domains.

\section{Extensions}
There are many other algorithms and classes of algorithm that were not described from the field of Swarm Intelligence, including:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Social Insects}: There are algorithms inspired by other social insects besides ants, such as: bees, wasps, fireflies, and termites.
	\item \textbf{Bacteria}: Another related area is that of algorithms inspired by the social-like properties of some bacteria which may be considered a swarm intelligence.
	\item \textbf{Cellular Systems}: There are algorithms inspired by social-like mechanisms in cellular systems like the immune system and cancers.
\end{itemize}
